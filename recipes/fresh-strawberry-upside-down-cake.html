  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>I live in Florida and have access to strawberries for a few months at a time. Many of my friends and neighbors can't wait until I start preparing this cake.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups crushed fresh strawberries</li>
    <li>1 (6 ounce) package strawberry flavored Jell-OÂ® mix</li>
    <li>3 cups miniature marshmallows</li>
    <li>1 (18 ounce) package yellow cake mix, batter prepared as directed on package</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Spread crushed strawberries on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking pan. Evenly sprinkle strawberries with the dry gelatin powder, and top with mini marshmallows.</li>
    <li>Prepare the cake mix as directed on the package, and pour on top of the marshmallows. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 to 50 minutes. Cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Run a knife around the pan to loosen the sides, and turn the cake out onto a serving tray. Store cake in the refrigerator.</li>
  </ol>
