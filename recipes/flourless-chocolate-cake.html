  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Perfect for chocolate lovers and people who can't have gluten! Great for entertaining, deceptively easy to make. I flour the pan using cocoa powder so it won't leave white marks on the cake and keeps it totally gluten free. Serve warm — either topped with whipped cream or dusted with powdered sugar — alongside a scoop of ice cream. For a chocolate ganache topping, see footnotes!</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate, chopped</li>
    <li>½ cup butter</li>
    <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>½ cup cocoa powder</li>
    <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch round cake pan, and dust with cocoa powder.</li>
    <li>In the top of a double boiler over lightly simmering water, melt chocolate and butter. Remove from heat, and stir in sugar, cocoa powder, eggs, and vanilla. Pour into prepared pan.</li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely, 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
  </ol>
